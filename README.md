# broccoli

The idea is for broccoli to become a lightweight inventory management system with basic point of sale functionality.

## Requirements

- Node.js `v18.12.1`
- MongoDB

## Installation

Run `npm install` in both the root and client directory to restore all dependencies.

Create a new environment variable `MONGO_URI` that contains your MongoDB cluster connection string.

## Usage

Run the `npm run dev` command from the root of the application to start both the Node.js server and Svelte development server.

## Known Issues

Too many to list as this project is still in early development.
